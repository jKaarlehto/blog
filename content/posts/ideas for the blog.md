I want this blog to emulate some kind of old terminal, but still have a modern feel.

I want to add a border that looks like the [Tekkit computer](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftekkitclassic.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FComputer&psig=AOvVaw3WHq8DbM01eEtA12yY1qcC&ust=1751754075413000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCKCS0s6epI4DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE).

Images would be black and white plus pixelated (maybe pixelation could be correlated to distance from the mouse or something). They could then be rendered normally on hover for info purposes.
